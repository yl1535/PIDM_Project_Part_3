# PIDM_Project_Part_3

# Current work separation plan:
# Yue Luo, Xanne -- Writing XML
# Kriti       -- Writing DB SQL
# Harish    -- Complete checklist, README.md, record demo vide

#Note:
There's a bug for customer page that is very hard to fix, so I'd just leave it there. The bug is this: if you go into search mode for both "Book the trains" and "Question box" window, exiting search mode of the first one will also lead to exit of the third one. Please do not let this happen in our video (if we can have time record that)
