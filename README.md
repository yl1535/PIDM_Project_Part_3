# Note1:
Schedules that are out-of-date will not be deleted from the schedule table,and will not be shown on the Customer Page since customers cannot make reservations on a schedule which occured in the past. Though CRs and Admins may still reach data of those schedules and edit them.

# Note2:
For checklist of admin, I put the third functionality, produce a list of reservations, and the fourth functionality, produce the total revenue, together into the third rectangle. Now, when choosing the type and input name, the third rectangle will automatically form a list of reservations by given Transition Line Name or Customer Username, and also automatically calculate the total revenue generated by them, all displayed in the same modal window.
