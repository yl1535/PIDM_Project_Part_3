# PIDM_Project_Part_3

# Please do not use PIDM_Project_Part_3 as parent folder to run in eclipse! Use CS336_Group6_1.6241807 instead, or just import the war file
# We need to submit the zip file, do not submit the folder or the war file

# Current work separation plan:
# Yue Luo, Xanne -- Writing XML
# Kriti       -- Writing DB SQL
# Harish    -- Complete checklist, README.md, record demo vide

# Note:
There's a bug for customer page that is very hard to fix, so I'd just leave it there. The bug is this: if you go into search mode for both "Book the trains" and "Question box" window, exiting search mode of the first one will also lead to exit of the third one. Please do not let this happen in our video (if we can have time record that)
# Note2:
For checklist of admin, I put the third functionality, produce a list of reservations, and the fourth functionality, produce the total revenue, together into the third rectangle. Now, when choosing the type and input name, the third rectangle will automatically form a list of reservations by given Transition Line Name or Customer Username, and also automatically calculate the total revenue generated by them, all displayed in the same modal window. Be sure to include this in final README file and the Demo Video.
# Note3:
Just a simple thing, deleting a CR Account using Admin permission will also removes its name for ReplyUsr in QuestionBox, but later create another CR Account with same Username won't recover this name, this is logical.
