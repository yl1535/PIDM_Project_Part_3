# PIDM_Project_Part_3

# Current work separation plan:
# Yue Luo, Xanne -- Writing XML
# Kriti       -- Writing DB SQL
# Harish    -- Complete checklist, README.md, record demo vide

# Note:
There's a bug for customer page that is very hard to fix, so I'd just leave it there. The bug is this: if you go into search mode for both "Book the trains" and "Question box" window, exiting search mode of the first one will also lead to exit of the third one. Please do not let this happen in our video (if we can have time record that)
# Note2:
For checklist of admin, I put the third functionality, produce a list of reservations, and the fourth functionality, produce the total revenue, together into the third rectangle. Now, when choosing the type and input name, the third rectangle will automatically form a list of reservations by given Transition Line Name or Customer Username, and also automatically calculate the total revenue generated by them, all displayed in the same modal window. Be sure to include this in final README file and the Demo Video.
